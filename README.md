# HSTS Support

So this is merely a 7.x OSGi-ified update of Olaf's original project, https://github.com/olafk/liferay-hsts-hook

Please check there for the relevant technical details.

In this rewrite, the configuration has moved out of the portal-ext.properties file and into OSGi Configuration Admin, so there are new
panels in the System settings area for the HSTS configuration.

All of the same notes and details that Olaf reported in his original project still apply.
