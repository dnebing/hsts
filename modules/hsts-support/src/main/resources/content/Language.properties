hsts-configuration-name=HSTS Configuration
hsts-configuration-description=Configure the value to the number of seconds that you want to instruct the client browser to purely use https to connect to this domain. A common value suggestion is 31.536.000, equivalent to 365 days. For testing purposes, you want shorter values, e.g. 10 minutes. According to RFC 6797, you'll need a certificate trusted by your browser in order for the setting to be active. A self-signed certificate won't do the trick. Also, you'll need to access the site on https and you'll need to use the standard ports, e.g. 443 for https.
